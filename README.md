# android-camera-permission

This plugin adds the android.permission.CAMERA permission to the Android platform.

The needs for this plugin arose when developing real-time video chat using Twilio WebRTC for my [Ionic app](http://engineerstoolbox.com/tinder-clone-source-code/) which uses Parse on the backend.

## Installation

    cordova plugin add android-camera-permission

## Supported Platforms

- Android
